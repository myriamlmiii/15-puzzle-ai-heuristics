Project Title: 15-Puzzle Solver Comparison

Description:
This project explores various search algorithms to solve the 15-puzzle game. The primary focus is on comparing the A* search algorithm utilizing the Manhattan Distance heuristic against traditional methods like BFS, DFS, and UCS.

Project Structure:
- automate.py: Runs the puzzle-solving algorithms on different scenarios.
- compare.py: Compares the performance of the algorithms.
- fifteenpuzzle.py: Contains the logic for the 15-puzzle game and the implementation of the A* algorithm.
- generator.py: Generates puzzle scenarios.
- scenarios.csv: Contains different starting scenarios for the 15-puzzle.
- search.py: Contains the search strategies implementations.
- util.py: Utility functions used across the project.

How to Run the Project:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install necessary Python packages by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
3. Execute 'python automate.py' to run the solver on predefined scenarios.
4. Execute 'python compare.py' to compare the performance of different search strategies.
